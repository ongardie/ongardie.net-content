<p>
I installed the web server <a href="https://www.lighttpd.net">lighttpd</a>
on my laptop to test some configuration settings. As I didn't want to expose
the server on the network, I uncommented
<code>server.bind = "localhost"</code> from
<code>/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf</code>.
</p>

<p style="clear: both">
Then, restarting lighttpd failed with the following error:
</p>
<pre>
<span style="display:none">(network.c.201)</span>getaddrinfo failed:  Name or service not known ' localhost '
</pre>

<hr />

<p>
This is lighttpd 1.4.19-5 from main on Debian Lenny.
</p>

<p>
I was still able to ping localhost and checked my <code>/etc/hosts</code> file,
but everything seemed fine. Finally, I checked the line of code the error
points to (network.c line 201) and noticed it's part of an IPv6-specific chunk
of code.
</p>

<p>
I found I could work around this issue by disabling IPv6 entirely in
<code>/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf</code>. For the uninitiated, comment out this
line:
</p>
<pre>
&#35;&#35; Use ipv6 only if available.
include_shell "/usr/share/lighttpd/use-ipv6.pl"
</pre>

<h2>Other Reports of This Issue</h2>
<p>
A couple reports of the
same problem can be found on the old lighttpd forums, but no resolution was
reached. Unfortunately, I can't reply there because those forums are now
locked, and historical threads were not copied to lighttpd's new forums. The
first report was from Debian's 1.4.19-1 package, and the second report does not
identify the version.
</p>

<p>
A <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-user-spanish/2009/03/msg00751.html">post</a>
on the debian-user-spanish list reports the same problem on Debian Lenny but
received no replies.
</p>

<p>
That mailing list post does point to
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=489063">Debian bug 489063</a>
(which doesn't come up on Google when you search for the error message). There,
Pierre Habouzit, one of lighttpd's maintainers on Debian, suggests using
<code>server.bind = "::1"</code> instead of <code>server.bind = "localhost"</code>
when IPv6 is enabled. This will start up the server without errors, but then I
can only access it as <code>http://ip6-localhost/</code> (not
<code>http://localhost/</code>).
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This is a pretty annoying little issue, and it hasn't fully been resolved.
At a minimum, this:
</p>
<pre>
&#35;&#35; bind to localhost only (default: all interfaces)
# server.bind                = "localhost"
</pre>
<p>
should be:
</p>
<pre>
&#35;&#35; bind to localhost only (default: all interfaces)
&#35;&#35; use ::1 when IPv6 is enabled or localhost for IPv4
&#35;&#35; (see Debian bug #489063)
# server.bind                = "::1"
# server.bind                = "localhost"
</pre>
<p>
That would at least point people in the right direction.
</p>
<p>
I've sunk enough time into this for now, though.
I'll post an update here if I pursue this any further.
