I use Linux exclusively but run Microsoft PowerPoint for some presentations. I
won't go into the details of why here, but I wanted to record and share a few
tips I use for getting it to run well. Your mileage may vary, obviously.

Most importantly, as of this writing, you want no later than PowerPoint 2010.

The first problem I had is that when I drag a selection rectangle or move
objects around, the entire drawing area went black. The workaround I use gives
Wine a big rectangle to manage and draw on. Run <code>cxsetup</code>, go to
"Wine Configuration", under the "Graphics" tab, enable "Emulate a virtual
desktop". You'll want to set the resolution (size of the rectangle) based on
your monitor (I use 1590x840). I still get a black rectangle covering the
contents of my selection (not the whole drawing area as before), but it's
fairly usable that way.
</p>

<p>
The second problem was that some bullets weren't displaying correctly; they
were showing an empty rectangle instead. I resolved this by copying a random
version of <code>wingdings.ttf</code> (with that exact spelling, I guess) into
<code>~/.cxoffice/<wbr />Microsoft_Office_2010/<wbr />drive_c/<wbr />windows/<wbr />Fonts</code>.
Then I had to quit my bottle in <code>cxsetup</code>; no idea what that means.
</p>

I find that it's pretty stable and works pretty well after those changes
(though I don't use most of the advanced features or animations). Still, I'd
suggest saving frequently. And I always render to PDF and use a native PDF
viewer for the actual talks. That's a good idea in general but also necessary
due to the fixed size virtual desktop, which won't fit nicely on different
projector sizes.
