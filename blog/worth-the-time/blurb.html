Today's <a href="http://xkcd.com">XKCD</a> starts to answer: how much time
should I spend making a routine task faster?

I really like this comic. As a Ph.D. student, I have a lot of control over how
I spend my time, and this question comes up a lot. (I'm even writing about
analyzing how I spend my time.) Relative to the people I work with, I think I
err on the side of spending more time optimizing my workflow, and I think
programmers in general tend to do this more than others.
</p>

<p>
Obviously you shouldn't spend all your time optimizing. We joke that one
optimizing friend (Aleks) will only need one keystroke by the time he's done;
it'll set off some sort of complex scheme for something-or-other. The details
are moot, of course, since he'll never reach that point.

<p>
Still, I don't think Randall's chart is the definitive answer. It can be rational
to spend more time "optimizing" than you'd na√Øvely expect to shave off:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
You may grossly underestimate how much time you shave off. If you're
eliminating a frustration, in particular, the expected time should include lost
productivity due to becoming frustrated. If these minor frustrations add up,
eventually you'll just shut down.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Improvements to your workflow can be shared if they apply to other people; this
multiplies their effect. This is why I'd rather have my labmates use the same
tools as me.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Although doing a routine task is usually not interesting, optimizing a routine
task often is. So at least for me, the path to getting something done may be
shorter through optimization rather than through procrastination.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Improving your workflow makes you faster at improving
your workflow. The experience and knowledge gained while doing this leads
to making faster improvements next time around. It also exposes low-hanging
fruit for other workflow improvements you may not have considered.
This argument may seem circular, but it's not: you're shaving time off future
optimizations, which shaves time off tasks that you wouldn't have otherwise
optimized.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
These arguments aren't earth-shaking, but at least there's some ammunition to
use in defense of over-optimizing.
