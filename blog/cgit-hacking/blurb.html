  Last week I hacked a couple new features into
  <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/">cgit</a>, a web interface for
  Git, since it's the one I [previously used] on ongardie.net. I added
  <code>https://</code> URLs for the Atom feed and also syntax highlighting
  when viewing files.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>HTTPS URLs for Cgit's Atom feed</h2>
<p>
  Cgit generates Atom feeds so that you can keep track of changes from your
  feed reader. Unfortunately, that requires a full URL, which it assumed
  started with
  <code>http://</code>. This obviously didn't work for
  <code>https://</code>-only installations.
</p>
<p>
  I modified cgit to check the <code>HTTPS</code> CGI variable. If it's set to
  <code>on</code>, cgit now generates full URLs starting with
  <code>https://</code>. While this isn't part of the official CGI spec, most
  servers will set it, including Apache and lighttpd.

  Lars Hjemli, the maintainer of cgit,

    >merged in my change</a
  >, so it should be part of a future cgit release:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    This looks good. I've merged it into my wip-branch [...] where I'll let it
    cook for a little while before merging to my master.
  </p>

<h2>Syntax Highlighting for Cgit</h2>
<p>
  Cgit is useful for browsing around a project's history, but it didn't do
  syntax highlighting for source code. This made it unpleasant to use for
  reading complete files (as opposed to diffs).
</p>

<p>
  I modified cgit to make use of the
  <a href="http://www.andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/highlight.php"
    >highlight</a
  >
  program, when available, to color source code. If highlight is unavailable or
  fails, cgit falls back to the old black-and-white view.
</p>

<p>
  While the patch is small and self-contained, it's specific to highlight and
  just tacked on in the source code. Lars didn't take this one:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I like the result, but I think the implementation has to be more generic.
    And I'm currently about to add support for a few plugins/hooks to cgit
    which I think can be used to achieve the same result so lets see how that
    works out first, ok?
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  I'll be working with Lars on getting a cleaner solution merged into his tree
  once he's added support for plugins.
