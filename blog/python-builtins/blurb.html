<p>
So, I just realized that I re-implemented two built-in Python
functions on a small project I'm working on for
<a href="http://www.etszone.com">ETSZONE</a>.
I just didn't know that these existed, so I'm writing about them here
in case you've overlooked them too.
</p>

<h2><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#sorted">sorted</a></h2>
<p>
This is useful if you want to sort a copy of a list. Use
<code>sorted()</code> instead of copying the list and then using
<code>list.sort()</code>.
</p>
<p>
This was my re-implementation (and I think I still like its name
better):
</p>
<pre>
def sort(seq, **args):
    x = list(seq)
    x.sort(**args)
    return x
</pre>
<p>
The <code>sorted</code> function has been available since Python v2.4.
</p>

<h2><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#enumerate">enumerate</a></h2>
<p>
This is useful when you want a foreach loop, but you also need a loop
counter around. Use <code>enumerate()</code> instead of keeping a
counter elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
For example, I was writing out a spreadsheet with
<a href="http://ooolib.sourceforge.net/">ooolib-python</a>.
For each spreadsheet cell to write, I had to specify row and column
indexes. I could write more natural loops with <code>enumerate</code>,
while still having a counter to use as a row or column index.
</p>
<p>
This was my re-implementation (and its name would have never caught
on):
</p>
<pre>
def indexiter(iterable):
    return zip(range(len(iterable)), iterable)
</pre>
<p>
The <code>enumerate</code> function has been available since Python v2.3.
Read about the optional <code>start</code> parameter in the
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#enumerate">docs</a>
- it looks useful, but it's new in Python 2.6.
</p>

<hr />
This shows that it's a good idea to occasionally browse back through
the very basic support a language gives you, since you might just find
a couple useful tools in there that you had overlooked. If you're into
Python, start
