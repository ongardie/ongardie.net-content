I went up to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks_(San_Francisco,_California)">Twin Peaks</a>
in San Francisco with <a href="http://jicksta.com">Jay</a> a few weeks ago. It
was a nice view but kind of a worst-case scenario for a photo: my iPhone camera
(VGA), poor lighting as the sun was setting, and stong winds.

That day I took a bunch of overlapping shots with my phone. Then I used the
<a href="http://www.gimp.org">GIMP</a>'s automatic white balance correction on
each of them. Next I stitched them together with
<a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net">Hugin</a>, and finally I edited
the stitched image with the GIMP. The following mediocre image is the result
(<a href="${VAR_URL_PREFIX}/blog/twin-peaks/pan_large.jpg">click</a>

The 1 megapixel result really wasn't worth the time. Even in the thumbnail,
it's easy to see that multiple source images are contributing their different
colors and brightness levels. Maybe Hugin could correct for more of this with
the proper settings, but I haven't taken the time to learn it well enough to
know how. Although mine has a slightly larger angle, I think
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:San_Francisco_panorama_from_Twin_Peaks.jpg">the one on wikipedia</a>
still wins.

I also took this suprising shot:

It turns out the iPhone's cheap camera scans horizontally from top to bottom.
As I was in a car moving left, the lines lower on the image were scanned later
and appear shifted to the right. Kirk Mastin has an
<a href="http://lofihistyle.com/2008/11/iphone-rolling-shutter-creative/">interesting post</a>
about this rolling shutter effect and what you can do with it.
Jeffrey Erlich also has an awesome
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jerlich/sets/72157614852342118/with/3331783600/">album</a>
that makes use of this effect.
