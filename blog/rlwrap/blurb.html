Dealing with a basic command-line prompt in a loop can be painful, so many
programs, such as shells, interactive programming languages and debuggers,
provide a more featureful prompt. For example, pressing the up and down arrows
in a good prompt will flip through previously entered input lines. Programs
will often make use of the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/readline/">GNU readline library</a> for this
functionality.
</p>

<p>
If you need to use a program that only has a basic prompt, you may be able to
wrap it with the program
<a href="http://utopia.knoware.nl/~hlub/uck/rlwrap/#rlwrap">rlwrap</a> to get
some more advanced features. From the man page:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
rlwrap  runs  the  specified command, intercepting user input in order to
provide readline's line editing, persistent history and completion.
</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>
There are many options to add (programmable) completion, handle multi-line
input, colour and re-write prompts. If  you  don't need them (and you probably
don't), you can skip the rest of this manpage.
</p>

For example, I recently used rlwrap with jdb, the Java debugger, and Ikarus, a
Scheme compiler.
