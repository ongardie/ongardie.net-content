I store nearly all files of even moderate importance in
<a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> (including this blog post). These are
usually plain-text files, but sometimes it's necessary to put binary files
under version control. Unfortunately, those are typically difficult to diff and
merge, but I recently discovered some features of Git that make this less
painful. This blog post focuses on <a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a>
database files, but at least some of it applies to other binary file types.
</p>

<p>
My problem specifically involved managing changes to an SQLite database that
contained results for a research study. The database was changing as new
results arrived and were processed, and it was important to me to track its
changes in case of manual or programming errors.
</p>

<p>
SQLite stores its database in a pretty complex format
(<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html">described here</a>).
While diffing two SQLite databases can sometimes be human-readable, this
entirely depends on the binary that happens to fall right around the modified
values. It's doable but sometimes requires a lot of annoying horizontal
scrolling past screenfuls of control characters. Life's too short for that.
</p>

<p>
SQLite can dump entire databases out as SQL statements, and Git can be
configured to do this when generating diffs. In a
<code>.gitattributes</code> or <code>.git/info/attributes</code> file, give
Git a filename pattern and the name of a diff driver, which we'll define
next. In my case, I added:
</p>
<pre>
db.sqlite3 diff=sqlite3
</pre>

<p>
Then in <code>.git/config</code> or <code>$HOME/.gitconfig</code>, define the diff driver. Mine looks like:
</p>
<pre>
[diff "sqlite3"]
    textconv = dumpsqlite3
</pre>

<p>
I chose to define an external <code>dumpsqlite3</code> script, since this can
be useful elsewhere. It just dumps SQL to stdout for the filename given by its
first argument:
</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
sqlite3 $1 .dump
</pre>

<p>
At this point, <code>git diff</code> should show you plain-text diffs, as
should browsing Git commits. There's still one problem left: sometimes SQLite's
binary database will change, but the actual database contents remain the same.
This results in a <code>git status</code> that says the database has changed
but a <code>git diff</code> that says it hasn't.
</p>

<p>
I don't know enough about SQLite to know why this happens. I thought it was
because SQLite doesn't compact free space right away in its database files, but
I ran into a case where even if I vacuum two database files with identical
contents, they still have different binaries.
</p>

<p>
One brute solution would be to dump the database contents to SQL and read
them back into a "fresh" SQLite database. This should result in a canonical
binary database, since SQLite doesn't seem to store anything like a
timestamp in there. I suspect you could have your diff driver do this
automatically every time it runs, but I haven't tried it yet.
