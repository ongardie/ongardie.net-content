I just read about Stack Overflow DevDays on <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com">Joel on Software</a>
(<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/05/12.html">post</a>):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It's going to be in October, in five separate cities. In each city, we're
planning a one-day event.
</p>

<p>
We decided to cram as many diverse topics as possible into a single day
event. Like a tasting menu at a great restaurant, we'll line up six great
speakers in each city.
</p>

<p>
This is not going to be just a Java conference or a .NET conference or a
Ruby conference. This will be completely ecumenical. We'll have somebody to
introduce Microsoft's new web framework, ASP.NET MVC, but we'll also get
someone to talk about writing code for Google's new mobile operating
system, Android. And in each city, we'll find one local computer science
professor or graduate student to tell us about something new and
interesting in academia.

I picked up one of the $10 student tickets for San Francisco.
Now, I'm not a big <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>
user, but, at that price, I had to go for it. I'm especially hoping to hear
more about the first 4 topics listed:
Android, Objective C and iPhone development, Google App Engine, and Python.
