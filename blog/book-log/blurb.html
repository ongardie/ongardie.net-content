In addition to my <a href="${URL_PREFIX}/misc/movies/">movie log</a>, I've now
started a <a href="${URL_PREFIX}/misc/books/">book log</a> going back to last
summer.

<h2>100 Movies by May 10th?</h2>
<p>
In other news, the movie log is now up to 87 films. I hadn't yet cranked out
any numbers with it, but this announcement is as good a time as any to start,
right?

The movie log seems to grow roughly linearly over time. Assuming that a linear
model fits the data and that I am capable of basic statistics (neither of which
we should count on), I will have watched 100 films by the 716th day since the
start of the log, which comes out to May 10, 2010. Here's a pretty graph:
