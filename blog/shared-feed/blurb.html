<p>
Lately, I've been sharing items from my news feeds on Google Reader that I find
interesting. You can view these
<a href="https://www.google.com/reader/about/">on the web</a>
or as an
<a href="https://www.google.com/reader/about/">Atom feed</a>.
(You don't need to be a Google Reader user yourself to view my shared items.)
