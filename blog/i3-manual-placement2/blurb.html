This is the second part of a series on making the i3 window manager work the
way I want. I left off
<a href="${URL_PREFIX}/blog/i3-manual-placement">last time</a>
with the goal of changing the way windows are placed as they are created, and I
had a couple of pointers from the i3 hacking howto for where to start looking.
This post covers how I've set up my test environment.
</p>

<p>
I started looking in <code>src/manage.c</code> but soon found my way into
<code>src/con.c</code>, which does most of the grunt work surrounding
containers. There are a ton of conditional branches in the i3 source code,
so running i3 with debug logging on (<code>i3 -d all</code>) was essential in
figuring out which code paths were being executed.
</p>

<p>
One particularly relevant log message, <blockquote>Inserting con = x after last
focused tiling con y</blockquote> led me to <code>con_attach()</code>, the
function in charge of placing a new window in i3's layout tree. I think that's
one key function I'll need to change.
</p>

<p>
I started playing around with changing the layouts of things and creating extra
containers in there but quickly got frustrated. The problem was that I was
<em>using</em> my buggy version of i3 while iterating on the code and testing.
Testing also became difficult, since running the tools to analyze what's going
on requires opening new windows, but opening new windows affects i3's state.
</p>

<p>
A better approach is to run i3 inside a nested X server. This way you can keep
your editor, browser, and other tools open outside of the test environment, and
keep the test environment minimal, clean, and easy to reset.
</p>

<p>
I had used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xnest">Xnest</a> in the past,
but I found that i3bar didn't display fonts for me under Xnest. I don't know
what the problem was there, but I came across
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xephyr">Xephyr</a>, a replacement for
Xnest that supports modern X extensions. Fortunately, Xephyr can run i3 and
i3bar properly. Xephyr allows the nested server to grab the keyboard (toggled
with Ctrl+Shift), which is quite handy for window manager development.
</p>

<p>
I'm also getting a lot of mileage from i3's <code>contrib/dump-asy.pl</code>
script, which uses i3's JSON-based IPC interface to show you a graphical
representation of the layout tree. This script has been helpful in
understanding the tree transformations that occur as I test my changes to i3.
For example, it's showing me that I have a bunch of nested containers with only
one child (oops). I've made a few minor improvements to the script, and Michael
Stapelberg has already accepted a couple of these minor patches.
</p>

<p>
To use <code>contrib/dump-asy.pl</code> with a nested X server, you need to
help it find i3's IPC socket. It uses
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/AnyEvent::I3">AnyEvent::I3</a> internally,
whose default constructor finds the i3 running on your current
<code>DISPLAY</code>. You don't want to launch the script with the
<code>DISPLAY</code> set to the nested X server, since then it would launch
also launch <code>gv</code> inside the nested X server. Instead, construct the
AnyEvent::I3 instance as follows, for a nested X server running on
<code>DISPLAY=:1</code>:
</p>

<pre>
chomp(my $path = qx(DISPLAY=:1 i3 --get-socketpath));
my $i3 = i3($path);
</pre>

<p>
Now that I can use my editor reliably and query what's going on in a controlled
testing environment, I should be able to make some real progress.
