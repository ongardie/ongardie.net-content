Client-side web programming (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) has improved greatly in
recent years. You could make a reasonable argument that this is the best
environment for building user interfaces today: it's quick, it looks decent,
there are tons of libraries and stylesheets available, and the
developer tools are quite good. Firefox even has a
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/3D_view">3D Inspector</a>
view these days &mdash; if that doesn't convince you, I don't know what will.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, <a href="nodejs.org">node.js</a> has become a reasonable platform
for server-side JavaScript that interacts with the outside world. Node provides
libraries for accessing the filesystem, making network requests (not just
HTTP), and running arbitrary processes. And it has over 25,000 third-party
libraries to help you out.
</p>

<p>
This environment already makes sense for building local applications. You'd run
a node.js server locally to handle interaction with the outside world, and
you'd load up a web page in your browser to provide the user interface. Your
browser and server would communicate over HTTP requests as usual.
Hide the browser's toolbars and it doesn't even look out of place.

<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit">node-webkit</a> project
takes this one forward: it integrates the node.js libraries into a
<a href="http://www.webkit.org">Webkit</a> environment. So now
instead of splitting your local application into a server and a client
component, having these communicate over HTTP, and having to launch these
separately, you can structure these applications in a much simpler way. There's
no HTTP involved: your JavaScript just acts on user input directly, calling
into node.js libraries when it needs to.

I've been playing around with node-webkit a bit the last few days, and I must
say I'm impressed with how productive of an environment it is to program in.
The number of JavaScript libraries out there really makes up for the ugly bits
of the language. I feel like I've been shying away from building graphical
applications because of the overhead of doing so with something like PyGTK; I
think node-webkit might change this. Node-webkit applications require so little
boilerplate that this approach makes sense even for one-off scripts where you'd
like user interaction.
