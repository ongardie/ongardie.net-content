Version 7 of Vim introduced tabs to the editor, and these are a few of
my tab-related tips.

<h2>Open Files in Tabs</h2>
<p>
If you want to open multiple files in their own tabs in a new Vim
session, use the <code>-p</code> flag on the command line for
<code>vim</code> or <code>gvim</code>. For example, to open all files
in the current directory, use the following:</p>
<pre>
vim -p *
</pre>

<p style="padding-top: 10px">
When you give Vim multiple files to edit, its default behavior is to
use several buffers. If you want to use tabs as the default behavior
instead (that is, without typing the <code>-p</code> flag every time),
set up a couple shell aliases. For bash, place these in your
<code>~/.bashrc</code>:
</p>
<pre>
alias vim='vim -p'
alias gvim='gvim -p'
</pre>

<p style="padding-top: 10px">
Also, Vim will open a maximum of 10 tabs like this by default. To
increase that limit to, for example, 50, add the following to your
<code>~/.vimrc</code>:
</p>
<pre>
set tabpagemax=50
</pre>

<h2>Easier Tab Navigation</h2>
<p>
When you have more than a few tabs open, it can become difficult to
navigate them with only the keyboard. You can use
<code>{count}gt</code> to go to the <em>count</em>-th tab
(starting with 1), but counting them yourself is a waste of time.
Placing the tab number on its label solves this problem.
