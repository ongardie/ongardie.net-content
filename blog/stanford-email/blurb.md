Now that I've graduated, Stanford has deleted my university email account,
`ongaro@stanford.edu`. If you tried to send to that address and received an
autoreply, please resend your email to the same username at `cs.stanford.edu`
instead, which should remain valid for life. (Yes, I had a [very similar
post](${URL_PREFIX}/blog/rice-email) for my Rice email account a few years
ago.)
